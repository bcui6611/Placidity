# Placidity

Placidity can be thought as a Python wrapper that sits on top of your existing shell. This means it allows you to evaluate simple Python expressions, stash the results and perform usual actions you do on a shell. It is fairly easy to extend thanks to its architecture.

Note that output coloring depends on [colorama](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama)! It works without it, though.

If you are on mac, you might want to install readline package as this enables tab completion for commands.
